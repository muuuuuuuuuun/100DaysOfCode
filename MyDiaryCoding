##Day 1
Today I learned about what the hell im doing right now. Yeah, that's right: Github. I already have created my github account a long  time ago, but I don't know how to use it till this day. So yeah,
currently exploring this app by doing this challenge thing, 100 days of code. Hope that my future me will be consistent update this github thingy.

Also, I do a bunch of JavaScript things in freeCodeCamp. Seriously, that website is the best. I learned a lot doing their free projects, although sometimes its the questions are quite tough and I had to use ChatGPT
for it. But yeah, Im trying to be consistent with it.

Just so you know, at this point, I had intermediate understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. But if you ask me to do projects, maybe im going to be slow as heck.

Welp, sorry for the language too. I will try to improve by doing this diary. Cant wait for the future me to read this first and being embarrassed/proud of the progress.

So yeah, that's it. BYE!
